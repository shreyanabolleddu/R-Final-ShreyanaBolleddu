## Purpose and Background

As glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness and still not fully understood, research surrounding it could be greatly beneficial in finding effective treatments.
Some studies show that glaucoma is associated with decreased levels of neurotransmitters, GABA and Glutamate, creating a potential target for these treatments. 

This data set is pulled from a study that explored whether the amount of GABA and Glutamate in the visual cortex is affected by glaucoma. 
If so, the study would further investigate what independent effects this may have on neural specificity (the brain's ability to respond to stimuli accurately).

This study recruited 40 patients with glaucoma: 14 with early glaucoma and 26 with advanced glaucoma.
A healthy group of 24 age-matched subjects was used as a control.

The data set was obtained from the NYU Data Catalog (NYU Health Sciences Library).

## REVISE THIS

Using statistical analysis and data visualization, we should be able to see if there is a decrease in GABA and/or Glutamate, and its associations with neural specificity.

For the purposes of this study, we are going to focus on the neurotransmitters in the visual cortex specifically.

## Import Data 

Data was provided as an Microsoft Excel file. This was converted to a CSV file to be uploaded into RStudio.

```{r}

#Reading in the CSV file 
glauc <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shreyanabolleddu/R-Final-ShreyanaBolleddu/main/RFinalData.csv")

#Display the first few rows of data to confirm proper import
head(glauc)

#Display summary to better understand data
summary(glauc)

```
Table containing the demographic information, neurochemical profiles (GABA/Glutamate concentrations), and ophthalmic measures of the 64 subjects (40 experimental, 24 control) 


***

## Begin Data Exploration

All values are currently being read as characters - we will adjust this as necessary.

```{r}

#Display summary to better understand data
summary(glauc)

```

***

## Continue Data Exploration and Cleaning

We are going to focus on the neurochemical profiles, so we are gonna to create a subset of the relevant data.

```{r}

#Create a new data frame containing only the columns involving neurochemical profile information
glaucNeurochem <- glauc[1:10]

#Rename columns (column names were originally shifted to first row to help with formatting)
colnames(glaucNeurochem) <- c("ID", "Age", "Gender", "Severity group", "Gaba/tCr", "Glutamate/tCr", "GABA/NAA", "Glutamate/NAA", "Neural specificity", "Gray matter volume of visual areas")

#Remove the first row and reset row names
glaucNeurochem <- glaucNeurochem[-1, ]
row.names(glaucNeurochem) <- NULL
head(glaucNeurochem)

```

***

# Continue Data Cleaning and Refactor

Some columns of the data need to be converted to numeric and relabeled. 

We will also factorize some columns and handle the NA values.

Overall, any changes that would make the data easier to be manipulated during statistical analysis will be perfomed.

```{r}

#Convert necessary columns to numeric (this step also handles the NAs by setting them the way we want)
glaucNeurochem[,c(2,5:10)] <- lapply(glaucNeurochem[,c(2,5:10)], as.numeric)

#Create factors for the Gender and Severity group columns
glaucNeurochem$Gender<- factor(glaucNeurochem$Gender)
glaucNeurochem$`Severity group`<- factor(glaucNeurochem$`Severity group`)

#Check that data is organized
summary(glaucNeurochem)

```
